      <h2>What is the differnce between Margin,Border and padding </h2>
      <p>The information written above is what surrounds the space between
         the image or text also known as the content. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Margin is the space outside of the border and padding. It can overlap other elements.</li>
          <li>Border is the surrounding space outside of the padding and content. It's what gives the element a border.</li>
          <li>Padding  is the space between the border and the content, it allows an open area in between the properties.</li>
          The text below is how you may apply the properties in your CSS file. The div is the element. 
        <p>
  <br>div{
	<br>  margin: 20px;
	<br>  border: 2px solid #color;
	<br>  padding: 10px;
  <br>}
      </p>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What is best practice when using Classes and ids</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Id is for an individual element while class can be used for multiple elements under the same class. </li>
          <li>When it comes to naming the elements you can use the same name for an ID and class because they have their own significance.</li>
          <li>It's best to not use Id when linking to CSS it is more suitable for a Javascript file because Id can only be used once per page.</li>
        </ul>

       <h2> What is the difference between Relative, absolute and Fix positioning</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Relative positioning allows you to adjust the element moving up, down, left, or right. </li>
        <li>Absolute positioning is an element that is positioned to its nearest positioning ancestor. </li>
        <li>Fixed positioning will stay fixed to the page even when you scroll on the page. </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Display inline vs inline block</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>block element takes up more space than a inline elements, the border continuse after the text.
             But the parent limits the size to the rest of the blocks.</li>
        <p>The text below is how you my use it in CSS</p>
        <p>
          <br>div{
          <br>	display:block;
          <br>}
        </p>

        <li>Diplay inline will display next to one another or side to side. 
          It only takes up as much room necerssary, wraps around the text. </li>
          <p>The text below is how you my use it in CSS</p>
          <p>
            <br>div{
            <br>	display:inline;
            <br>}
          </p>
       </ul>
