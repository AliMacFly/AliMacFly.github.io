      <h1>How does neuroplasticity relate to learning </h1>
      <p>The brain can evolve throughout its life and adapt to acquiring new skills. 
        Neuroplasticity is the ability to rewire your brain, making it stronger or 
        weaker depending on how you use it. Neuroplasticity can help the brain repair 
        itself and expand its learning potential. 
        Synapses’ can grow from reoccurring use or disappear from barely using the 
        connections between the synaptic pathways. A synapse is the muscle connection 
        between neurons that’s why cognitive learning is important for brain growth.
        </p>

        <h2>How does neuroplasticity benefit people</h2>
        <p>Since we now understand that a skill can be lost, practicing a task every day 
          or over time will help develop long-term memory and a stronger synapse.
          After an injury neuron connection can be lost, but the neuro paths will 
          regenerate through relearning or training.  </p>

        <h2>Principles in neuroplasticity </h2>
          <p>There are 10 principles of how to make the most out of neuroplasticity.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>	Use it or lose it – A lack of motor skills can eventually lead to physical
              muscles being useless. Physical and mental activities are important to hold 
              onto your full body and brain capability.</li><br>

            <li>	Age – Younger brains are easily and more adaptable to learning, that’s why 
            it’s important to teach children the right things at an early age a negative 
            trait can linger from early development.</li><br>

            <li>	Repetition – Regular practice is essential for neuroplasticity; repetition
            leads to strong neuro connection.</li><br>

            <li>	Interference – The brain’s ability for changing and adapt to new 
            environments or skills, such as learning two languages back-to-back the
             neuro pathways will interfere with one another making it harder to learn 
             a new skill to its full potential, but if you separate your crafts into 
             different days, it’s less like to clash with connecting pathways.</li><br>

            <li>	Salience – A significant experience such as an accident can cause 
              emotional salience, it can lead to long-lasting fear and stress from 
              memory and increased activity in the amygdala and the hypothalamus. 
              This principle helps determine to enhance cognitive abilities with 
              emotions or meaningful learning experiences.</li><br>

            <li>	Transference or Generalization – A change of environment can make
              learning a skill more effective. Applying new context to learning the 
              skill gives the brain adaption in a variety of situations.</li><br>

            <li>	Intensity - The brain responds to challenges and more hours into
              learning a new subject. With high focus and effort, there is a higher 
              chance of faster learning and understanding of the subject. </li><br>

            <li>	Time – It takes time for information to settle in your memory.
              Continued practice of a task creates an improvement in abilities and when
              you take a long break, for example, 6 months there is a possibility of
              a decline in the abilities that you may want to improve on. </li><br>
                
            <li>	Specificity – The value of tailoring to learning a task and adapting 
              to new skills to the individuals, as they can enhance the neuronal 
              connections and brain function.</li><br>

            <li>	Use and Improve – Enhancing learning experiences by using and improving
               earlier training and learning journey. </li><br>
          </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion - How to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>To grow new neuro connections and increase your ability to learn, is repletion
          and challenge yourself once you get comfortable. Time can also be important when
          it comes to neuroplasticity to get the best out of your learning, only take 
          short breaks enough to reflect but if you don’t practice the physical task,
          it can deteriorate the neuro connection and be able to complete the task correctly.</p>
